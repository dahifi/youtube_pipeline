# LLM Assisted Youtube Pipeline
![Example banner](./assets/header.png)

This repo is something I put together to assist with my [100 Days challenge playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ_ZWdfWBMKsLgcocR3D_Zboa2C1WhBiy). It's presented as-is with no promises to maintain it, and is presented solely as a professional exercise. You can read more about it [here](http://wade.digital/blog/youtube-pipeline):
